# What does a “changing mole” look like?

Moles are common skin growths, and most are harmless. However, a changing mole can sometimes be a sign of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer, so it's important to know what to look for and when to seek medical advice. This post will help you understand what constitutes a "changing mole" and guide you through the crucial signs to watch out for.

## Understanding Moles and Melanoma

Moles, also known as nevi, are typically small, round, and evenly colored. Melanoma develops when melanocytes (the cells that produce pigment in the skin) become cancerous. Changes in existing moles, or the appearance of new, unusual moles, can be early indicators of melanoma.

### The ABCDEs of Melanoma

The ABCDE rule is a helpful guide for identifying potentially problematic moles:

*   **A**symmetry: One half of the mole does not match the other half.
*   **B**order: The edges are irregular, blurred, or notched.
*   **C**olor: The mole has uneven color or contains multiple colors (black, brown, tan, red, white, or blue).
*   **D**iameter: The mole is larger than 6 millimeters (about ¼ inch) across, although melanomas can sometimes be smaller.
*   **E**volving: The mole is changing in size, shape, color, elevation, or any other trait. This includes new symptoms such as bleeding, itching, or crusting.

## Key Warning Signs: What to Watch Out For

Beyond the ABCDEs, pay attention to these additional signs:

*   **Rapid Growth:** A mole that increases in size quickly (over weeks or months) warrants attention.
*   **Changes in Texture:** A mole that becomes scaly, crusty, or feels different to the touch.
*   **Itching or Pain:** Persistent itching, pain, or tenderness in or around a mole.
*   **Bleeding or Oozing:** Any mole that bleeds or oozes without an obvious injury.
*   **Satellite Moles:** The appearance of new, smaller moles near an existing mole.

## Myth vs. Fact

**Myth:** All dark moles are cancerous.
**Fact:** Most dark moles are harmless. However, any new or changing dark mole should be evaluated by a dermatologist.

**Myth:** If a mole is small, it can't be melanoma.
**Fact:** Melanomas can sometimes be small, even smaller than 6mm. Size isn't the only factor.

**Myth:** Melanoma only occurs in areas exposed to the sun.
**Fact:** Melanoma can occur anywhere on the body, including areas not typically exposed to the sun.

## Regular Skin Self-Exams

Regular self-exams are crucial for early detection. Examine your skin carefully at least once a month, paying close attention to all moles and blemishes. Use a mirror to check areas that are difficult to see, or ask a family member or friend for help.

## Conclusion

Being vigilant about changes in your moles and seeking professional evaluation when necessary can significantly improve your chances of early melanoma detection and successful treatment. Don't hesitate to consult a dermatologist if you have any concerns about a mole. Early detection is key.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I do if I notice a changing mole?

Schedule an appointment with a board-certified dermatologist as soon as possible. They can perform a thorough skin examination and, if necessary, a biopsy to determine if the mole is cancerous.

### How is a suspicious mole diagnosed?

A dermatologist will typically perform a biopsy, which involves removing all or part of the mole and examining it under a microscope.

### How can I protect myself from melanoma?

Practice sun safety measures: wear sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, seek shade during peak sun hours, and wear protective clothing, including a hat and sunglasses. Avoid tanning beds.

### Are some people more at risk for melanoma?

Yes, risk factors include a family history of melanoma, fair skin, a large number of moles, history of severe sunburns, and a weakened immune system.
