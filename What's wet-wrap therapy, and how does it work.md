# Whatâ€™s wet-wrap therapy, and how does it work?

Wet-wrap therapy is a simple yet effective treatment often used to soothe and heal inflamed skin, particularly in eczema and other dry skin conditions. It involves applying a layer of moisture followed by a layer of damp cloth and a final layer of dry clothing to hydrate and protect the skin. This helps reduce itching, inflammation, and promotes healing.

## Understanding Wet-Wrap Therapy

Wet-wrap therapy aims to rehydrate the skin, reduce inflammation, and increase the absorption of topical medications. It works by providing a physical barrier that prevents scratching and keeps the skin moist, creating an optimal environment for healing.

### Who Can Benefit from Wet-Wrap Therapy?

Wet-wrap therapy is commonly recommended for individuals experiencing:

*   Eczema (atopic dermatitis)
*   Severe dry skin
*   Skin irritation and inflammation
*   Itching and scratching

### How to Perform Wet-Wrap Therapy: A Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Gather your supplies:** You'll need emollient/moisturizer, clean lukewarm water, soft cotton bandages or clothing (like pajamas or socks), and a dry outer layer of clothing.
2.  **Hydrate the skin:** Soak or bathe in lukewarm water for 10-20 minutes. Pat the skin gently with a soft towel, leaving it slightly damp.
3.  **Apply Moisturizer:** Generously apply a thick layer of your prescribed emollient or moisturizer to the affected areas.
4.  **Apply the Wet Layer:** Soak the cotton bandages or clothing in lukewarm water, wring out the excess water, and apply them to the affected areas. The wraps should be damp, not dripping wet.
5.  **Apply the Dry Layer:** Cover the wet layer with a dry layer of clothing or bandages. This helps keep the moisture in and prevent the wet layer from drying out too quickly.
6.  **Leave on for the appropriate time:** Your dermatologist will advise on the correct duration. Typically, leave the wraps on for a minimum of two hours or overnight.
7.  **Rehydrate and Reapply:** When removing the wraps, reapply moisturizer immediately to maintain skin hydration.

### Important Considerations

*   Use lukewarm, not hot, water.
*   Change the wet wraps regularly, as directed by your dermatologist.
*   Avoid using wet-wrap therapy on infected skin unless directed by your doctor.
*   Be sure to follow your dermatologist's specific instructions.
