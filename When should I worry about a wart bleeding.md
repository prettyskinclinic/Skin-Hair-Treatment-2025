# When should I worry about a wart bleeding?

Warts are common skin growths that most people experience at some point. While usually harmless, a bleeding wart can sometimes be a cause for concern. Let's explore when bleeding warrants a closer look.

## Why Do Warts Bleed?

Warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which triggers rapid cell growth on the skin's surface. They contain tiny blood vessels that feed the growth, making them prone to bleeding if irritated or injured. Common causes of bleeding include:

*   **Picking or scratching:** This is the most frequent reason. Warts, especially plantar warts (on the feet), can be itchy or bothersome, leading to accidental or intentional picking.
*   **Aggressive treatment:** Over-the-counter wart removal products, especially those containing salicylic acid, can sometimes damage surrounding skin and cause bleeding if used improperly.
*   **Friction:** Warts in areas subject to friction, such as the hands or feet, may bleed due to rubbing against clothing, shoes, or other surfaces.
*   **Trauma:** A direct blow or injury to a wart can cause it to bleed.

## What to Do When a Wart Bleeds

If your wart bleeds, here's what you should do:

*   **Wash the area:** Gently clean the affected area with mild soap and water.
*   **Apply pressure:** Use a clean cloth or bandage to apply direct pressure to the wart until the bleeding stops. This usually takes a few minutes.
*   **Cover the wart:** Once the bleeding has stopped, apply a clean bandage to protect the area from further irritation and infection.
*   **Avoid picking:** Resist the urge to pick at the scab or surrounding skin.

## Warning Signs: When to See a Doctor

While minor bleeding is usually not a concern, you should consult a dermatologist if:

*   **Bleeding is excessive or prolonged:** If you can't stop the bleeding after applying pressure for 10-15 minutes.
*   **Signs of infection appear:** Look for increased pain, redness, swelling, pus, or fever.
*   **The wart changes in appearance:** Any changes in size, shape, color, or texture should be evaluated by a doctor.
*   **The bleeding recurs frequently:** If the wart bleeds repeatedly without a clear cause.
*   **You are unsure if it's a wart:** If you’re not certain it’s a wart and it's bleeding, get it checked.

## Myth vs. Fact

**Myth:** Bleeding warts always mean cancer.

**Fact:** While skin cancer *can* sometimes resemble a wart, bleeding from a wart is most often due to trauma or irritation, not cancer. However, any unusual or changing skin growth should be evaluated by a dermatologist to rule out any serious conditions.

## Conclusion

A bleeding wart is typically not a cause for major alarm, particularly if it's the result of picking or minor injury. However, keeping an eye on it, taking the proper steps to stop the bleeding, and knowing when to seek professional help are important.
