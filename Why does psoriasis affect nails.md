# Why does psoriasis affect nails?

Psoriasis isn't just a skin condition; it can affect your nails too. Nail psoriasis is surprisingly common, affecting up to 50% of people with skin psoriasis and up to 80% of people with psoriatic arthritis. Understanding how and why it happens can empower you to manage it effectively.

## How Psoriasis Impacts Nail Health

The root cause of nail psoriasis lies in the same inflammatory process that affects the skin. Psoriasis causes skin cells to grow too quickly. When this happens under the nail (in the nail matrix, which is where the nail grows from), it disrupts normal nail formation. This leads to a variety of visible changes in the nail itself.

### Common Nail Psoriasis Symptoms

Nail psoriasis manifests in several distinct ways:

*   **Pitting:** Small, pinpoint depressions on the nail surface. This is perhaps the most common sign.
*   **Onycholysis:** Separation of the nail plate from the nail bed. This can create a white or yellowish discoloration at the tip or sides of the nail.
*   **Subungual hyperkeratosis:** A chalky, white buildup of skin cells under the nail. This can cause the nail to thicken and lift.
*   **Oil drop sign:** A yellowish-red discoloration visible through the nail, resembling a drop of oil under the nail plate.
*   **Transverse grooves (Beau's lines):** Horizontal lines across the nail, indicating a temporary interruption of nail growth.
*   **Nail crumbling:** The nail becomes brittle and may break easily.
*   **Splinter hemorrhages:** Small, dark red or brown lines that run vertically under the nail.

### Factors That Worsen Nail Psoriasis

Several external and internal factors can exacerbate nail psoriasis:

*   **Trauma:** Injury to the nail or surrounding tissue can trigger or worsen symptoms.
*   **Infections:** Fungal infections can mimic or worsen nail psoriasis.
*   **Medications:** Certain medications may trigger or exacerbate psoriasis.
*   **Stress:** Stress is a known trigger for psoriasis flares, which can include nail involvement.
*   **Exposure to irritants:** Frequent hand washing and exposure to harsh chemicals can irritate the nails and surrounding skin.

## Managing Nail Psoriasis at Home

While nail psoriasis can be stubborn, there are several steps you can take to manage symptoms at home:

*   **Keep nails short:** Trimming your nails regularly helps prevent trauma and reduces the risk of infection.
*   **Moisturize:** Apply a thick emollient cream or ointment to your nails and cuticles several times a day to keep them hydrated.
*   **Avoid trauma:** Protect your hands and feet from injury by wearing gloves when doing housework or gardening.
*   **Consider nail hardeners (with caution):** Some nail hardeners can help strengthen brittle nails, but be cautious as some contain ingredients that can further irritate the skin.
*   **Avoid artificial nails:** Acrylic or gel nails can trap moisture and increase the risk of fungal infection, worsening nail psoriasis.

## Myth vs. Fact

**Myth:** Nail psoriasis is just a cosmetic issue.

**Fact:** Nail psoriasis can be painful and debilitating, affecting hand and foot function and quality of life. It can also be a sign of psoriatic arthritis.

## When to Seek Professional Help

While home care is essential, consult a dermatologist if:

*   Your nail psoriasis is severe or significantly impacting your daily life.
*   You experience pain, swelling, or redness around the nails, suggesting an infection.
*   Home remedies are not providing adequate relief.
*   You suspect you may have psoriatic arthritis.

## Conclusion

Nail psoriasis is a common manifestation of psoriasis that can significantly impact your well-being. While it can be challenging to manage, understanding its causes, symptoms, and available treatments can help you take control and improve your quality of life. Don't hesitate to seek professional help for personalized management strategies.
